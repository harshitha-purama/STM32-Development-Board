Learnings and Gains from the STM32 Development Board Project
This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of PCB design and embedded systems development. Here's a summary of the key skills and knowledge I gained:

Core PCB Design Skills:

KiCad Proficiency: I gained hands-on experience using KiCad for schematic capture and PCB layout. This included:

Creating schematics with electronic components.

Designing a two-layer PCB layout.

Routing traces, including power and signal traces, and managing ground planes.

Generating Gerber files for manufacturing.

Component Placement and Routing: I learned how to effectively place components for optimal circuit performance and manufacturability. I also practiced routing techniques to minimize signal interference and ensure efficient power distribution, including the use of ground planes.

Design Rule Checks (DRC): I learned to use and resolve DRC violations, specifically clearance errors, to ensure the PCB meets manufacturing specifications.

Bill of Materials (BOM) Management: I created a BOM, which improved my understanding of how to document all the components required for PCB assembly.

Embedded Systems Knowledge:

STM32 Microcontrollers: I gained practical experience working with STM32 microcontrollers, a very popular family of microcontrollers.

Microcontroller Peripherals: I learned about key interfaces like USB, SWD, and UART, and their roles in programming, debugging, and communication.

Basic Circuit Design: I reinforced my understanding of fundamental electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) and their functions in a circuit.

Problem-Solving and Design Challenges:

Power Distribution: I encountered challenges in efficiently routing GND and 3.3V power traces, and implementing a ground plane. This improved my ability to design robust power distribution networks.

Space Optimization: I had to overcome component spacing issues to create a compact design. This taught me how to balance circuit functionality with size constraints in a multi-layer board.

Balancing Aesthetics and Functionality: I learned that a good PCB design needs to be both functional and visually appealing.

Overall, this project has provided me with a solid foundation in PCB design and embedded systems. I am now better equipped to design and develop electronic circuits and work with microcontrollers, including multi-layer boards with ground planes.
